              <Card.Text>
                Rakshak integrates seamlessly with existing CCTV infrastructure to scan live video
                feeds for visible weapons. When a threat is detected, the system immediately sends
                alerts to the control room ‚Äî complete with image snapshots, location metadata,
                and time stamps ‚Äî enabling swift and informed decisions.

                We are committed to protecting individual privacy. Rakshak never stores personal data,
                and all alerting is based solely on visual threat detection ‚Äî not identity recognition.
                Security should never come at the cost of civil rights.
