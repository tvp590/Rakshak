# Rakshak - Real-Time Surveillance System for Weapon Detection

## Project Idea

Our team aims to develop an innovative **Real-Time Weapon Detection Surveillance System** called **Rakshak**. This system is designed to enhance public safety by providing real-time weapon detection in surveillance footage. By leveraging AI and machine learning, **Rakshak** enables instant alerts for potential threats, helping authorities respond quickly and mitigate risks in critical environments.


## Project Background

**Rakshak**, meaning `protector` or `guardian` in Hindi and Sanskrit, reflects our mission to enhance safety in public spaces. With the rise in safety concerns at schools, universities, and public spaces due to incidents involving weapons, itâ€™s crucial to find effective ways to keep everyone safe. Traditional surveillance systems depend on human operators, which can sometimes lead to delays in identifying threats. **Rakshak** aims to change that by using advanced technology to automatically detect weapons in real time. This way, security teams can receive instant alerts and respond quickly to any potential danger.

By implementing **Rakshak** in various environments, we hope to create a safer atmosphere for all individuals present. The system not only enables security personnel to act promptly but also provides peace of mind, knowing that an extra layer of protection is in place. This innovative approach to surveillance is designed to make our public areas and venues safer for everyone.
