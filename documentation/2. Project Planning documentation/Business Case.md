# Business Case

| **Project Name** | Rakshak - Real-Time Weapon Detection System |
| :--- | :--- |
 **Date Produced**     | October 15th, 2024  |
| **Background**        | Public safety remains a key concern in environments like schools, airports, and public events. Traditional surveillance systems lack real-time intelligence, relying solely on human operators to identify and respond to threats, which may result in delays or missed threats. Rakshak seeks to mitigate these risks by incorporating AI to automate threat detection in real-time. |
| **Business Need/Opportunity** | There is an urgent need for a system that can efficiently detect potential weapons in surveillance footage, reducing human error and improving the response time of security teams. With an increasing demand for enhanced security measures, especially in public spaces, Rakshak offers an innovative solution using AI/ML technology to streamline threat detection and alerts. |
| **Options**           | |
| 1. Develop the Rakshak System (AI/ML model integration with real-time alert system) | Develop the Rakshak system with an AI/ML model for real-time weapon detection, integrated into the existing CCTV network. Includes real-time alerts and a user-friendly dashboard. |
|| **Pros** : Provides continuous automated monitoring, significantly reduces human error, improves response time, and the intuitive dashboard enhances usability for security teams. |
| | **Cons** : Higher initial costs for development and deployment, with an ongoing need for AI model training and updates. |
| 2. Deploy Sensor-Based Detection Systems | Implement sensor-based detection systems (e.g., metal detectors, X-ray scanners) for threat detection. |
| | **Pros** : Adds a layer of security to detect unauthorized weapons, low cost for limited locations, and ideal for small or controlled spaces. |
| | **Cons** : Not suited for comprehensive, large-scale surveillance since sensors are effective only in controlled areas or specific entry points. Requires pyhsical installation and maintenance. |
| 3. Human-Monitored Surveillance with Manual Alerts | Continue with a human-monitored surveillance setup, where personnel manually monitor live feeds and alert authorities as needed. |
|| **Pros** : No new development costs, minimal training required for security teams. |
| | **Cons** : High risk of human error, slower response times, and limited scalability. |
| **Recommendation** | Option 1 (Develop the Rakshak System) is recommended for its ability to provide real-time automated threat detection, improve response times, and enhance operational efficiency for security teams. The initial investment in AI/ML development will yield long-term benefits in terms of safety and security. |
| **Cost-Benefit Analysis** |  |
| **1. Build a custom AI/ML model** | **Cost**: $700 for cloud resources (Google Colab Pro and AWS for training and deployment). Data collection (curating/labeling) = $1,000| 
| | **Benefit**: Full control over the model. The model can be fine-tuned and iterated during development, optimizing performance without relying on external vendors. |
| **2. AI/ML Model Integration and Full Stack Development** | **Cost**: $30,000 for 6 months of AI/ML model, system integration, and troubleshooting. |
| | **Benefit** : Integrates the AI/ML model for real-time weapon detection with full-stack development, ensuring seamless back-end operations, database management, and front-end dashboard functionality. |
| **3. UI/UX Design and Dashboard Development** | **Cost**: Estimated $2,500 for UI/UX design and front-end development.|
| | **Benefit**: An intuitive, user-friendly dashboard design for real-time monitoring and alerts, enhancing the operational efficiency of security personnel.|
| **4. Testing and Deployment** | **Cost**: Estimated $2,000 for system testing and deployment.|
|| **Benefit**: Thorough testing ensures all components (AI/ML model, dashboard, back-end systems) function as expected before going live. This minimizes the risk of errors or failures in production. Smooth deployment ensures that the system is fully operational and secure, reducing downtime and ensuring a stable production environment.|
| **Total Development Cost** | **$36,200** |
