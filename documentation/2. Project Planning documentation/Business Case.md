# Business Case

| **Project Name** | Rakshak - Real-Time Surveillance System for Weapon Detection |
| :--- | :--- |
 **Date Produced**     | October 15th, 2024  |
| **Background**        | Public safety remains a key concern in environments like schools, airports, and public events. Traditional surveillance systems lack real-time intelligence, relying solely on human operators to identify and respond to threats, which may result in delays or missed threats. Rakshak seeks to mitigate these risks by incorporating AI to automate threat detection in real-time. |
| **Business Need/Opportunity** | There is an urgent need for a system that can efficiently detect potential weapons in surveillance footage, reducing human error and improving the response time of security teams. With an increasing demand for enhanced security measures, especially in public spaces, Rakshak offers an innovative solution using AI/ML technology to streamline threat detection and alerts. |
| **Options**           | |
| 1.                    | Build a custom AI/ML model that processes surveillance footage to detect weapons and triggers real-time alerts. |
| 2.                    | Integrate this AI/ML model into the existing surveillance system for weapon detection. |
| 3.                    | Implement a real-time alert system and create a user-friendly dashboard to allow security teams to monitor alerts and manage responses efficiently. |
| **Cost-Benefit Analysis** |  |
| **1. Build a custom AI/ML model** | **Cost**: Moderate cost for cloud resources (Google Colab Pro for model training and AWS for deployment), along with minor costs for any additional software tools or libraries needed. Data collection and labeling may add additional costs in terms of human time. | 
| | **Benefit**: Full control over the model. The model can be fine-tuned and iterated during development, optimizing performance without relying on external vendors. |
| **2. Integrate AI/ML model into existing system** | **Cost**: Low-to-moderate cost for integration and testing.  |
| | **Benefit** : Leverages current infrastructure, avoiding the need for expensive new hardware. Quicker to implement and reduces overall setup and deployment costs. |
| **3. Implement a real-time alert system and user-friendly dashboard** | **Cost**: Moderate cost for software development and UI/UX design. |
| | **Benefit**: Enhances operational efficiency for security teams by providing real-time alerts and easy monitoring. Improves response times and reduces the risk of missed threats.|
