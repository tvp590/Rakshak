# Project Scope Statement

| **Project Title** | Rakshak - Real-Time Weapon Detection System |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project Deliverables** | **Detailed Description**          |
| **Minimum Viable Product (MVP 1)** | Build an AI/ML model capable of detecting weapons in live surveillance footage. The model should identify potential threats (e.g., guns, knives, rifles) in real time. |
| **Minimum Viable Product (MVP 2)** | Implement a real-time alert system with a user-friendly dashboard. The system should notify security personnel immediately when a weapon is detected and allow them to monitor and manage alerts efficiently. |
| **Minimum Viable Product (MVP 3)** |  Develop a cloud-based video storage system that enables secure storage of footage for later review and analysis.|
| **Project Exclusions** | No hardware will be developed for surveillance cameras. |
| | Facial recognition or identification of individuals in the footage is not included. |
| | Tracking of individual objects across multiple camera feeds to provide a comprehensive view of potential threats is excluded.|
| | Law enforcement response protocols are not part of this project's scope. |
