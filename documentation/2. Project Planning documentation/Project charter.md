| **Project Title** | Rakshak - Real-Time Surveillance System for Weapon Detection |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Date Produced**  | October 15th, 2024 |
| **Project Goals** | The primary goal of the Rakshak project is to enhance public safety through the development of an AI-based real-time weapon detection system. This system will monitor surveillance footage and instantly alert authorities when weapons are detected, allowing for faster response times in critical situations. |
| **Project Objectives** | Build an AI/ML-powered system that can analyze live surveillance footage to detect weapons. |
| | Implement real-time alerts to notify security personnel when potential threats are identified. |
| | Develop a user-friendly interface for security teams to monitor and respond to alerts efficiently. |
| **Project Budget** | Estimated budget of 500$ for development. 6 months of development time. |
| **Project Sponsor** | Professor Adam Tilson, University of Regina |
| **Project Manager** | Tirth V Patel |
| **Additional Key Project Stakeholders** |- Mr. Trevor Douglas, Project Mentor <br /> -  Law Enforcement Teams (Names TBD once the first designs of the project are presented) | 
| **Overall Project Milestones** | **Date** |
| **MVP 1** : Develop an AI/ML model capable of detecting weapons in surveillance footage | Estimated Completion: December 15th, 2024 |
| **MVP 2** : Implement a real-time alert system and create a user-friendly dashboard for security teams to monitor alerts and manage responses | Estimated Completion: February 15th, 2025 |
| **MVP 3** : Cloud-Based Video Analysis: Secure cloud storage for footage, enabling review and analysis at any time |
| **Project Risks** | Challenges in collecting high-quality, labeled data for training the AI/ML model|
| | Technical difficulties in integrating the AI/ML model with the surveillance system |
