# Mentor Meeting Notes

### Date: October 01, 2024
### Attendees: 
- Tirth Patel
- Yi Xu
- Mr. Trevor Douglas

## Agenda
1. Introduce the Rakshak System project idea.
2. Seek guidance on project scope and focus.
3. Gather suggestions for improving project relevance and feasibility.

## Discussion Points

**1. Project Introduction**
- The Rakshak System was introduced as a safety-focused project aimed at detecting weapons in real-time using computer vision and deep learning.

**2. Feedback from Trevor Douglas**
- Scope Reduction:
  -  For a team of two, it is advisable to narrow the project scope to specific environments such as schools or universities to maintain feasibility.
-  Capstone Guidance:
  - Highlighted that capstone projects are not always about building systems from scratch.
  - He mentioned that some people might choose to leverage pre-trained models and focus on creating meaningful web applications or tools around them, rather than developing everything from scratch.
  - Suggested reaching out to `Protective Services` to gather insights, requirements, and feedback to make the project more impactful and aligned with real-world needs if needed.
  
## Next Steps
1. Refine the project scope to focus on specific environments (e.g., schools or universities).
2. Explore pre-trained models suitable for weapon detection and integrate them into the system, or develop our own model.
3. Develop a roadmap to balance technical feasibility with real-world application.
