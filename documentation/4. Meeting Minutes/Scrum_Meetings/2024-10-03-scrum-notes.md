# Scrum Meeting Notes

### Date: October 03, 2024
### Attendees: 
- Tirth Patel
- Yi Xu
- Mr. Adam Tilson

## Agenda
1. Present the initial idea of the Rakshak System to the professor.
2. Seek feedback and suggestions for improvement.
3. Discuss the feasibility of using lab resources for training a YOLO model on a large dataset.

## Discussion Points

**1. Initial Idea Presentation**: 
The Rakshak system aims to detect weapons in real-time using computer vision and deep learning. The system will consist of: 
- A YOLO-based model for weapon detection.
- An alerting mechanism for potential threats.
- A monitoring dashboard for users.

**2. Feedback from Professor**: The professor, Adam Tilson, appreciated the idea and provided the following suggestions:
- Key Suggestions:
  - Consider strategies to minimize false positives to ensure system reliability.
  - Narrow the project focus to specific environments such as schools and malls to improve feasibility.
  - Decide and document the technologies to be used for the system.
  
**3. Lab Resource Request**: 
- We requested access to lab machines with high-performance GPUs to train the YOLO model on a large dataset efficiently. 
- Adam approved the request and offered assistance in setting up an account on the `lambda` machine for model training.

## Next Steps
- Distribute project tasks among team members.
- Focus on model development and training.
- Complete initial project documentation.
- Begin designing low-fidelity (LoFi) and high-fidelity (HiFi) prototypes.
