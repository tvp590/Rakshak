# Scrum Meeting Notes

### Date: November 07, 2024
### Attendees: 
- Tirth Patel
- Yi Xu
- Mr. Adam Tilson

## Agenda
1. Present the LoFi prototype of the Rakshak System.
2. Showcase initial model results trained on Google Colab.
3. Discuss suggestions for improving the model and prototype.
4. Plan for Bazaar Day presentations.

## Discussion Points

**1. LoFi Prototype Presentation**
- The team presented the low-fidelity (LoFi) prototype, demonstrating the envisioned user interface and alerting mechanism.
- Feedback from Adam:
    - The prototype is a good starting point for showcasing the system's potential.
    - Suggested further discussion on strategies to handle false positive scenarios.
  
**2. Model Training Results**
- Training Setup:
  - Due to pending lab machine access, the initial model was trained using Google Colab.
  - The dataset used was limited, and model training focused on testing feasibility.
- Performance Metrics:
  - **Recall**: 55%
  - **Accuracy**: 81%
- Feedback from Adam:
  - The results are promising for an initial run but need further improvement.
  - Recommended adding more data to enhance recall and overall model performance.
  
**3. Bazaar Day Plans**
- The team sought suggestions on what to present during Bazaar Day.
  -  Adam's Recommendations:
        - Showcase the LoFi prototype to gather feedback on usability and design.
        - If ready, demonstrate the HiFi prototype or initial working system.
        - Use this opportunity to seek feedback from other professors and students for further improvements.
  
## Next Steps
1. Enhance the dataset for model training to improve recall and accuracy.
2. Work on the HiFi prototype, incorporating feedback from the LoFi presentation.
3. Finalize the presentation plan for Bazaar Day, focusing on showcasing progress and gathering insights.
4. Continue coordinating with Adam for access to the labâ€™s `lambda` machine for more extensive model training.
