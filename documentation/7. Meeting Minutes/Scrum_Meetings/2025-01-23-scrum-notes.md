# Scrum Meeting Notes
### Date: January 23, 2025

### Attendees:
- Tirth Patel  
- Yi Xu  
- Mr. Adam Tilson  
- Other fellow capstone classmates

### Agenda
1. Showcase frontend static pages and initial API route testing for role-based access.  
2. Present initial thoughts on weapon detection and identification model.  
3. Discuss plans for dataset enhancement and improvements.  

### Discussion Points

**1. Frontend and API Route Presentation**  
- We showcased the static frontend pages and the initial API route testing results, focusing on role-based access.  

**2. Weapon Detection and Identification Model**  
- Adam suggested developing a new model to detect not only the weapon but also to identify the person carrying the weapon (police or unknown).  
- We discussed the feasibility of the model and agreed on the need to explore this avenue further in the upcoming iterations.  

**3. Dataset Enhancements**  
- Plans were made to develop a larger dataset with more diverse images of weapons and individuals carrying them.  

**4. Focus on CCTV Feed Streaming**  
- We will now focus on creating a streaming server for real-time CCTV feed streaming.  

### Next Steps
1. Develop the new weapon and identification model.  
2. Expand the dataset to include more data on individuals carrying weapons (police vs. unknown).  
3. Continue refining the frontend and API routes for further testing.  
4. Begin development of the streaming server for CCTV feeds.
